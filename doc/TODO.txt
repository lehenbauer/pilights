switch fade and gradient to work vertical rather than horizontally and they
won't have to create  and free floating point vectors to work with.  

use gd drawing primitives to draw stuff to create images.

do symmetry at times with horizontal reflection and at times also with vertcial reflection, i.e. reflection about some axis parallel to the X axis.

Drawing filled and stroke circles will look cool during playback.

Also add a primitive for shifting / rotating images.  beyond just circular shifting left allow i guess circular shifting of subranges.  so if you circle right the left half of the lights and circle left the right half, it will rotate inwards.

Add support for partial fills.  This is a lot like drawing rectangles.  Exactly like drawing rectangles if you use the graphics primitives to make lighting sequences.
